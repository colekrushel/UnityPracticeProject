- Researched using event managers 
- Implemented a basic event manager system
- Tried to use the event manager triggers to handle object inspection triggers but deemed unnecessary for the current scope (and confusing to implement)
- Worked on solutions to making handling object triggers one universal script rather than attached to each object
- Mentor Gabe assisted with questions

- Attempted to implement interaction by having a gameObject that is a child to the player handle object interactions
- child implementation encountered lots of bugs and just didn't work, so the script was moved to the player character instead successfully
